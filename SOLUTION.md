# Solution Steps

1. Create a new Next.js app using the 'app' directory and TypeScript support.

2. In 'app/page.tsx', implement the WeatherDashboard component with a stateful city input box.

3. Create a custom useDebounce hook to debounce user input by 600ms to prevent rapid API requests.

4. Whenever the debounced city input changes, start an async fetch to the (demo) OpenWeatherMap weather API (with API key and city name).

5. Show a loading spinner while fetching and clear when done. Show any errors if encountered.

6. Display the weather details in a styled panel upon successful fetch.

7. Use a ref value (latestQueryId) to prevent race conditions by only honoring the latest fetch result.

8. After a successful weather fetch, trigger a POST request in the background to '/api/log-search' with the city and timestampâ€”but do not await its result.

9. Implement the 'app/api/log-search/route.ts' API handler to receive POST requests with city and timestamp, and append each entry to an in-memory logs array.

10. Handle malformed requests in the API route and respond with proper errors if the payload is invalid.
